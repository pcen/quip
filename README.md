## quip
#### quantum computer simulator

An ideal quantum computer simulator that allows you to build and run quantum circuits. quip can interpret programs written in an assembly-like language as quantum circuits and simulate their output. It also provides a simple API through the `Circuit` class to build and simulate quantum circuits from a Python script. `Circuit` objects can be saved and loaded, as well as inserted into other quantum `Circuit` representations as a subcomponent.

This repository is a means for me to learn fundamental concepts of quantum computing and is liable to contain inaccuracies. Some great quantum computing resources are [QuTiP](http://qutip.org/) and [IBM Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/).
